# GameQuiz

## Project Description

GameQuiz is a simple game developed using a Windows batch script (.bat) that offers a fun and nostalgic experience. This project was one of my first during my childhood and early adolescence. Despite its simplicity, it is functional and features several capabilities, including support for multiple player profiles, profile creation and deletion, and interactive mouse-controlled buttons.

## Features

- **Multiple Profiles Support**: Create and delete player profiles.
- **Mouse Interactivity**: Interactive buttons for a dynamic experience.
- **Lives and Levels Management**: Manage lives and progress through levels.
- **Customization**: Options to change the screen and text colors and switch the current player.
- **Unique Questions Per Profile**: Each profile generates questions differently. The concept of the question remains the same, but the answer varies. For example, one profile might get "What is 23+5?" while another profile on the same level might get "What is 41+9?".
